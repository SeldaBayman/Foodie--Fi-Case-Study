üçΩÔ∏è Foodie-Fi Subscription Analysis SQL Project
Welcome to my Foodie-Fi SQL project! üéâ In this project, I performed an in-depth analysis of customer behavior and subscription patterns on the Foodie-Fi platform. Using SQL, I explored key business metrics, subscription trends, and customer upgrade/downgrade tendencies. Here‚Äôs an overview of what I‚Äôve accomplished in this analysis:

üîç Project Overview
This project focused on analyzing Foodie-Fi‚Äôs customer subscription data, revealing critical insights on customer preferences, subscription durations, and patterns across various plans.

Key Analyses:
Customer Distribution by Plan (as of 2020-12-31): Examined how customers are distributed across the Basic Monthly, Pro Monthly, Annual, Trial, and Cancelled plans, including percentage breakdowns.

Subscription Upgrades: Analyzed how many customers upgraded to the Annual Plan in 2020, and calculated the average time it took for customers to switch from any plan to an annual plan (found to be approximately 45 days!).

Time Period Breakdown: Grouped customers‚Äô transition times into 30-day periods (e.g., 0-30 days, 31-60 days, etc.) to see how quickly customers tend to upgrade.

Downgrade Analysis: Identified how many customers downgraded from the Pro Monthly plan to the Basic Monthly plan in 2020 and evaluated potential reasons behind this behavior.

üèÜ A-B-C Section Solutions
In addition to the general analysis, I successfully tackled the A-B-C Sections of the project:

A Section: Compared the success rates of different subscription plans by grouping customer data effectively.
B Section: Analyzed the trend of subscription cancellations over time, providing strategic insights into customer churn.
C Section: Explored correlations between metrics such as upgrades, downgrades, and cancellation tendencies, helping to better understand customer behavior.

üìä Insights & Learnings
This project gave me valuable insights into the subscription dynamics on the Foodie-Fi platform. Key findings include:

Customers tend to upgrade to Annual Plans within the first 45 days after joining.
The Basic Monthly plan has the largest customer base, while upgrades to Pro Monthly and Annual Plans require further incentives.
Downgrade trends suggest pricing sensitivity among some customers, particularly between the Pro and Basic plans.

üíª Technologies Used
SQL: Core analysis and data querying.
Data Visualization Tools (optional depending on if you used any tools for showcasing insights): To display key trends in customer behavior.
